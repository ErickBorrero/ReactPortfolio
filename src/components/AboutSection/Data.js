  description: `
    I am full-stack developer based in Central Florida. I don't have
    quarrels with any part of the stack as it is the challenge of
    figuring out the logic to make things work that infinitely propels
    me to code. I perceive myself to be an open/great communicator,
    easy to coach as I consistently strive to be objective and
    realistic with my capabilities as a programmer; due to my
    understanding that tech is an "ever-growing field" so a "great"
    solution today may be an "ok" solution tomorrow. Outside the world
    of coding, I am a family man to my wife and 2 daughters; and a
    life-long lover of all things games and anime.`,
